# ksd
It's an e commercer website.
Brand name - ksd creations(not a real company i just made that up).
I have used html and css in this project , no java script coz I'm still learning that.
I did not make css folder  instead I used all the styling inside the div's,containers,tags.  I know this project is not that much organised but hey its my first web project     
so we can cut some slack there.
thank you for reading this.
